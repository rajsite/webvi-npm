This project was initially created to experiment with CDN hosting of WebVI resources to enable services like https://glitch.com which can pull resources from npm.

Instead, to specifically enable WebVIs on glitch.com the following example was made: https://glitch.com/~glitch-serve-zip-asset

This repo will be archived and the package will be marked deprecated until another use case is found.

## webvi-npm
